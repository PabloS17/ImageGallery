# ImageGallery
The second project for the course "Programming languages". It is a system developed with Java to represent and manage the different taxa of nature.

## Description
The described problem is based on the implementation of a web application system using the object-oriented paradigm and additionally the MVC design pattern. This page will allow the user to manage images and information corresponding to species. The information managed by the page is divided into data such as image descriptions, creation date, keywords, author, and usage license, etc. Additionally, as an extra detail, it should also include taxonomic information describing the hierarchy of species.

Furthermore, the application must also work with a database as a persistence mechanism, and the images must be stored in a file system to reference their metadata.

Finally, regarding the functionality of the application, it must be capable of performing CRUD operations and should include a search engine for images with different criteria, such as keywords, taxa, authors, etc.
